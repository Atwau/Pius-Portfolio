      <div class="about-me_body">
        <p>Most importasnt to me has been a point where I have come to realize that learning never stops
        Completing my first degree in bachelor in medicine and bachelor in surgery to me was the beginning
      of my learning curve.</p>
        <p>During my training, I have always had change of interests every now and then. My first inspiration
        during my third year was to do paediatrics for my masters. However, after going through paediatrics
      rotation, I am sure I did not get any inspiration from anyone. So that dream just died there and then.
    Nevertheless, I had come from home with my dad's desire for me to be a surgeon, specifically an orthopaedic
  surgeon. My experience with my first orthopaedic surgery observation in theatre totally knocked me out of that
  game of orthopaedic surgery. I am not that aggressive. I like precision and minimal cutting. My experience in
in internal medicine during my third year was not also interesting to me. Obstetrics and gynaecology has Never
been my thing, so i rotated in obstetrics and surgery as part of the course requirement</p>
<p>I moved on to my 4th year, a year full of clinics. The only clinic I got involved so much in was ophthalmology.
this was not because i wanted to, but there existed a problem i had experience in person and in my family lineague,
LOW VISION. I took of some time to test my vision before the rotation ended, and truly i had low vision. Together with
my colleagues we organized a campaign to create awareness on blindness. It was only three month long, but it was just
enough to connect us to a number of eye health professionals.It was during this time that I got involved in the activities of
eye health africa.I assumed the role of content administrator for WCEA platform for eye health africa. I also volunteered
to run the youtube channel for eye health africa. I edited videos, helped in digital presence. I also got to know
Dr Paula Atubadzi, a Ghana, ophthalmologist and we collaborated in eye health activities.this I did through my fifth year </p>
<p>My pre intersship time was a time when I was in the cross roads. Thanks be to mentorship. I had gotten to know Dr Solomon Ondoma,
aneurosurgeon at MercyOne hospital inthe USA. I interacted with him on several occasions and shared my personal story with him.
This is where my journey in the field of neurosurgery started</p>
